# Bollywood Movies Ratings Analysis and Tag Insights

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of 779 Bollywood movies using collaborative filtering data to explore patterns in ratings, user-generated tags, and algorithmically generated content descriptors. It aims to identify factors that contribute to a movie's success and examine how user engagement reflects audience preferences.

## Project Goals

This study seeks to answer the following key questions:

- How have Bollywood movie ratings evolved over the decades?
- Which content attributes are most associated with highly rated movies?
- How do user-generated tags compare with algorithmic genome tags?
- What themes dominate the tagging and rating patterns?
- How does tag engagement correlate with movie quality?

## Dataset Details

- **Source**: MovieLens, IMDb, TMDB, and Kaggle Bollywood datasets
- **Movies**: 779 Bollywood films
- **Fields**: `movie_id`, `title`, `imdb_id`, `avg_rating`, `user_tags`, `genome_tags`, `release_year`, etc.
- **Ratings Scale**: 1.0 to 5.0
- **Tag Types**:
  - User tags: Generated by platform users
  - Genome tags: Algorithmically generated tags with relevance scores

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning

- Missing ratings were imputed using the global mean (2.88)
- Inconsistent tag formatting was standardized (trimming, lowercasing)
- Release years were extracted from titles using regular expressions
- Invalid or duplicate entries were removed

### Analysis Techniques

- Descriptive statistics and frequency analysis
- Tag correlation and relevance scoring
- Temporal rating trends by decade
- Variance analysis on tag-related ratings
- Tag overlap comparison between user and genome tagging

### Visualization

- Line plots for rating trends over time
- Bar charts for tag frequency and tag count by rating
- Word clouds for dominant themes
- Scatter plots and box plots for correlation and engagement

## Discussion

### Observations

- A strong correlation exists between tag count and movie ratings.
- Consistent overlap between user and genome tags is limited but confirms cultural identity themes.
- Ratings are distributed across decades, indicating quality recognition is not time-bound.
- Content with themes like sports or female directors shows high variance, suggesting divided audience opinions.

### Implications for Recommendation Systems

- Tag count serves as a proxy for content quality and user engagement.
- Cultural context (India-related themes) should be weighted in recommendations.
- A hybrid approach using both user and genome tags can enhance accuracy.
- Rating trends are stable across decades, suggesting temporal neutrality in recommendations.

## Limitations

- High percentage of missing tag data (over 90% marked as "unknown")
- MovieLens users may not fully represent the typical Bollywood audience
- Inconsistent tag formatting required extensive preprocessing
- Historical movie ratings may suffer from limited engagement or visibility

## Validation and Reliability

- Cross-system tag comparisons validate results
- Engagement correlation supports quality assessments
- Large sample size and diverse methods enhance robustness

## Conclusion

### Summary

This project analyzed Bollywood movies using collaborative filtering and tag data, uncovering:

- Temporal and genre-based rating patterns
- Clear relationships between tag engagement and content quality
- Cultural consistency in tag themes
- Practical recommendations for recommender systems

### Lessons Learned

- Tag-based engagement is a powerful indicator of movie quality
- Cross-validation between user and genome tags improves accuracy
- Data preprocessing is critical to ensure reliable results
- Multiple analysis perspectives lead to stronger conclusions
